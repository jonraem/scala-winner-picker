# scala-winner-picker
A simple Scala program to parse a text file and pick a predefined number of lines from it randomly.

How to run on Windows:
-
1. Install the Scala programming language distribution according to the guidelines given in this link: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html

2. Add the environment variables according to the link above.

3. Run <code>init.bat</code> in the source folder.

4. Add the content you wish to parse from to <code>parseable.txt</code>.

I have supplied a template parsable text file <code>parseable.txt</code> in the project folder which contains a list of different fruits. You can change the content of the text file as you see fit. The program parses the lines in the text into an array of <code>String</code> variables so make sure the items you want to pick something from are each separated by a new line.
